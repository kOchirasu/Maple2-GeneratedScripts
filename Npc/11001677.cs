                // $script:0704194107006585$

                // $script:0704194107006586$ 
                // - The $map:02000188$, the Banners of Glory, and a taxi stop are all conveniently located in the center of the city. For a reasonable fee, you can hire a taxi to take you to any other taxi stop you've visited, you know. Oh, and the job instructors from all over are gathered in the $map:02000188$.
                // $script:0704194107006587$ 
                // - The Banners of Glory in front of the palace mark the victories of certain powerful guilds and individuals. We update the banners all the time, so you can stop by whenever you like to see who has the most trophies and victories.
                // $script:0704194107006588$ 
                // - In the northern parts of the city, you'll find the royal office and library. $map:02000031$ is a must-see for any book lover, of course. It's not the biggest library in Maple World, but I like to think that it's the best. When I'm off-duty, I love to wander the stacks.

                // $script:0704194107006590$ 
                // - To the southwest, you'll find shops that sell equipment and other supplies. $npcName:11000004[gender:0]$ is one of the best smiths in the land, and $npcName:11000010[gender:1]$ sells all the latest herbs and potions. Never pick a fight without a stack of potions, I always say.
                // $script:0704194107006591$ 
                // - Head southeast and you'll find the residential district and hospital. Kick your feet up and relax after a long journey at $map:02000033$. Have your ailments treated by Tria's finest physician at $map:02000125$. And there's nothing $npcName:11000038[gender:0]$ can't cure.

                // $script:0704194107006594$ 
                // - $map:02000001$ is the political, economic, and cultural heart of Maple World, so it's always crowded. But in preparation for open court, there must have been ten times the normal number of people here.

                // $script:0704194107006612$

                // $script:0704194107006614$

Decorate your floors, walls, furniture, and yard to create a house that's unique to you. Some merchants will even sell buildings you can place on your lot! When you're ready to buy, go to $map:02000036$ to shop for your house.
                // $script:0704194107006615$
